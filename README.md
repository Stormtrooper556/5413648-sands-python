# Creating and manipulating signals project

This project is about creating, manipulating, plotting and testing signals. In the repository you will find a file that contains functions of signals, named "Signals". You don't need to run this file, but you can look at the function mechanics and explanations. There are also files where the signals have been plotted, manipulated and tested. The files with "plots" in the name are files with code that plot and manipulate the signals. The "Testing" file can be used with the command <pytest> to test if the functions work properly.

## How to run

To run the project, you need to have Python installed. In the repository there are a number of files. To run a file use the command:

```bash
python <filename>.py
```
